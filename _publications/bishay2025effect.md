title: "Effect of deep brain stimulation on nonmotor symptoms in essential tremor"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/bishay2025effect
excerpt: 'This study examined the effects of ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on nonmotor symptoms in patients with essential tremor (ET). Following DBS, we found a small but statistically significant improvement in depression scores, while anxiety remained unchanged. Cognitive testing showed slight declines in language and memory, but attention, executive function, and visuospatial function were unaffected. In sum, preoperative mood and cognitive scores were linked to post-DBS changes, highlighting the importance of individualized patient counseling when considering DBS for ET.'

This study examined the effects of ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on nonmotor symptoms in patients with essential tremor (ET). Following DBS, we found a small but statistically significant improvement in depression scores, while anxiety remained unchanged. Cognitive testing showed slight declines in language and memory, but attention, executive function, and visuospatial function were unaffected. In sum, preoperative mood and cognitive scores were linked to post-DBS changes, highlighting the importance of individualized patient counseling when considering DBS for ET.
