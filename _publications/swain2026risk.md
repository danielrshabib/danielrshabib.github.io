title: "Risk factors for dysphagia following total laryngectomy"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/swain2026risk
excerpt: "In this retrospective cohort of 787 patients who underwent total laryngectomy, 26.9% developed postoperative dysphagia and 16.6% required esophageal dilation over a median 28.5-month follow-up. Prior radiation, adjuvant radiation, and tongue base resection were independently associated with dysphagia, while total pharyngectomy and pedicled reconstruction showed associations on univariable analysis. Only prior radiation predicted the need for dilation. These findings from a large cohort highlight key surgical and treatment-related risk factors and support targeted counseling for high-risk patients undergoing total laryngectomy."

In this retrospective cohort of 787 patients who underwent total laryngectomy, 26.9% developed postoperative dysphagia and 16.6% required esophageal dilation over a median 28.5-month follow-up. Prior radiation, adjuvant radiation, and tongue base resection were independently associated with dysphagia, while total pharyngectomy and pedicled reconstruction showed associations on univariable analysis. Only prior radiation predicted the need for dilation. These findings from a large cohort highlight key surgical and treatment-related risk factors and support targeted counseling for high-risk patients undergoing total laryngectomy.
