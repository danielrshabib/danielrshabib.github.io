title: "Cost evaluation in head and neck cancer clinical trials: Implications for high-value care"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/collins2025cost
excerpt: 'Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients face some of the highest financial burdens of all cancer types due to complex, long-term treatments. However, this study of over 2,000 HNC clinical trials found that only 3.3% included cost as an outcome, and nearly all have yet to report results. This is lower than in many other cancers, despite rising healthcare costs and the importance of cost-effective care. These findings highlight a need for more consistent inclusion of cost data in trials to better guide treatment decisions and support patients facing financial hardship.'

Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients face some of the highest financial burdens of all cancer types due to complex, long-term treatments. However, this study of over 2,000 HNC clinical trials found that only 3.3% included cost as an outcome, and nearly all have yet to report results. This is lower than in many other cancers, despite rising healthcare costs and the importance of cost-effective care. These findings highlight a need for more consistent inclusion of cost data in trials to better guide treatment decisions and support patients facing financial hardship.
