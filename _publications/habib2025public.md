title: "Public awareness of hearing aids and cochlear implants: A Google Trends analysis of media campaigns"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/habib2025public
excerpt: 'Despite the growing need for hearing technology, public interest in cochlear implants (CIs) remains low compared to hearing aids (HAs). Using Google Trends data from 2004–2024, we found that HA-related searches steadily increased, while CI searches remained relatively flat. Only a few events, like International CI Day or major policy changes, led to brief spikes in CI awareness. These findings suggest a need for more sustained efforts to raise public understanding of CIs.'

Despite the growing need for hearing technology, public interest in cochlear implants (CIs) remains low compared to hearing aids (HAs). Using Google Trends data from 2004–2024, we found that HA-related searches steadily increased, while CI searches remained relatively flat. Only a few events, like International CI Day or major policy changes, led to brief spikes in CI awareness. These findings suggest a need for more sustained efforts to raise public understanding of CIs.
