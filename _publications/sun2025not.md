excerpt: 'Anastomotic leak is a serious complication after colon surgery, but its risk may vary depending on why the surgery is performed. In this large national study of nearly 84,000 patients, we found that people undergoing surgery for inflammatory bowel disease or diverticulitis were more likely to experience a leak compared to those with colon cancer or polyps. Inflammatory bowel disease posed the highest risk and often required additional, non-surgical procedures to manage the leak. These findings can help guide surgical decision-making and better inform patients about their risks.'

Anastomotic leak is a serious complication after colon surgery, but its risk may vary depending on why the surgery is performed. In this large national study of nearly 84,000 patients, we found that people undergoing surgery for inflammatory bowel disease or diverticulitis were more likely to experience a leak compared to those with colon cancer or polyps. Inflammatory bowel disease posed the highest risk and often required additional, non-surgical procedures to manage the leak. These findings can help guide surgical decision-making and better inform patients about their risks.
