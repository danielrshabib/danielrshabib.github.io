title: "Risk factors and rates for hypocalcemia after pediatric thyroidectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/aweeda2025risk
excerpt: 'This systematic review analyzed 67 studies encompassing 7,331 pediatric patients to assess hypocalcemia rates following total thyroidectomy (TT). Pooled incidence rates were 25.2% for transient, 7.4% for permanent, and 32.1% for any hypocalcemia. Risk was significantly higher in patients with malignancy, Graves&#39; disease, or those undergoing lymph node dissection. These findings highlight hypocalcemia as a common and clinically important complication in pediatric TT.'
