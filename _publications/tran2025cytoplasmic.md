title: "Cytoplasmic anillin and Ect2 promote RhoA/myosin II-dependent confined migration and invasion"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/tran2025cytoplasmic
excerpt: 'Cancer cells often migrate through tight spaces during metastasis, but how they do this is not fully understood. This study shows that anillin and Ect2, two nuclear proteins critical in cell division, are released into the cytoplasm during confined migration and help the cell move by activating myosin II. This process is intensified when the cell’s nucleus ruptures, releasing even more of these proteins. Together, anillin and Ect2 enable cancer cells to adapt to their environment and become more invasive.'

Cancer cells often migrate through tight spaces during metastasis, but how they do this is not fully understood. This study shows that anillin and Ect2, two nuclear proteins critical in cell division, are released into the cytoplasm during confined migration and help the cell move by activating myosin II. This process is intensified when the cell’s nucleus ruptures, releasing even more of these proteins. Together, anillin and Ect2 enable cancer cells to adapt to their environment and become more invasive.
