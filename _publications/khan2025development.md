title: "Development of a machine learning-based tension measurement method in robotic surgery"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/khan2025development
excerpt: 'Anastomotic leaks complicate up to 10% of the 300,000 colorectal surgeries performed annually in the U.S., with tension being a key but subjectively assessed risk factor. This study evaluates the feasibility of an objective method to measure mechanical tension in <i>ex vivo</i> porcine colons using a machine learning algorithm integrated with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). The algorithm estimated forces applied by robotic arms with high accuracy (up to 88%) and strong correlation (Spearman’s Correlation > 0.80) with ground-truth sensor data. This novel approach represents the first robotic measurement of tissue tension and has the potential to improve surgical outcomes by reducing anastomotic leaks.'

Anastomotic leaks complicate up to 10% of the 300,000 colorectal surgeries performed annually in the U.S., with tension being a key but subjectively assessed risk factor. This study evaluates the feasibility of an objective method to measure mechanical tension in *ex vivo* porcine colons using a machine learning algorithm integrated with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). The algorithm estimated forces applied by robotic arms with high accuracy (up to 88%) and strong correlation (Spearman’s Correlation > 0.80) with ground-truth sensor data. This novel approach represents the first robotic measurement of tissue tension and has the potential to improve surgical outcomes by reducing anastomotic leaks.
