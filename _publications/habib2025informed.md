title: "Informed consent challenges: A mixed-methods study of hospital ethics consultations"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/habib2025informed
excerpt: 'This study analyzed 4,127 hospital ethics consults to better understand real-world challenges in consent discussions. Consent-related consults (3.3%) more often involved adult and female patients and were typically lower in complexity than non-consent consults. Common issues included capacity, surrogate decision-making, and communication barriers, with capacity concerns significantly linked to surrogate decision-making issues. These findings highlight key areas to improve consent protocols and support ethical clinical care.'
