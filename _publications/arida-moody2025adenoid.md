title: "Adenoid regrowth and obesity in a longitudinal pediatric cohort"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/arida-moody2025adenoid
excerpt: "In this longitudinal cohort of 461 children undergoing adenoidectomy, we found that revision surgery was associated with higher BMI, younger age at primary intervention, undergoing initial adenoidectomy rather than adenotonsillectomy, and various comorbidities, with differing time-dependent effects. A second procedure was required for 29.5% of children at a median of 29 months. These findings highlight the potential role of obesity-related inflammation in adenoid hypertrophy and support more personalized surgical planning for children at risk of adenoid regrowth."

In this longitudinal cohort of 461 children undergoing adenoidectomy, we found that revision surgery was associated with higher BMI, younger age at primary intervention, undergoing initial adenoidectomy rather than adenotonsillectomy, and various comorbidities, with differing time-dependent effects. A second procedure was required for 29.5% of children at a median of 29 months. These findings highlight the potential role of obesity-related inflammation in adenoid hypertrophy and support more personalized surgical planning for children at risk of adenoid regrowth.
