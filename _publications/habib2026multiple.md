title: "Multiple drug-induced sleep endoscopy in pediatric obstructive sleep apnea: Obstruction patterns and outcomes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/habib2026multiple
excerpt: 'Children who continue to have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) after adenotonsillectomy (AT) often undergo drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) to identify airway blockages and guide additional surgery. In this study of 122 children, 27 (22%) required more than one DISE-directed procedure. Most children had multiple areas of obstruction, especially at the epiglottis and adenoids during repeat procedures. Children with higher body mass index (BMI) tended to need repeat surgeries sooner and showed more complex obstruction patterns. These findings highlight the importance of early, personalized treatment planning—particularly for children who are younger, have higher BMI, or exhibit  other medical conditions—and suggest that a single surgery may not fully resolve persistent OSA.'

Children who continue to have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) after adenotonsillectomy (AT) often undergo drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) to identify airway blockages and guide additional surgery. In this study of 122 children, 27 (22%) required more than one DISE-directed procedure. Most children had multiple areas of obstruction, especially at the epiglottis and adenoids during repeat procedures. Children with higher body mass index (BMI) tended to need repeat surgeries sooner and showed more complex obstruction patterns. These findings highlight the importance of early, personalized treatment planning—particularly for children who are younger, have higher BMI, or exhibit  other medical conditions—and suggest that a single surgery may not fully resolve persistent OSA.
