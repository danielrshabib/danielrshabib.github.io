title: "Less is more: Risk factors and survival outcomes of overtreatment for early-stage colorectal cancer"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/habib2025less
excerpt: 'This study examined overtreatment in early-stage (cT1-2N0M0) colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who underwent definitive resection without pathologic upstaging. Using National Cancer Database (NCDB) data from 2010–2020, we identified risk factors for overtreatment and analyzed its impact on overall survival (OS). Younger age, Black race, and pT2 tumors were linked to overtreatment in colon cancer, while pT2 stage, poor differentiation, and high-risk histology were associated with rectal cancer overtreatment. Overtreatment correlated with worse OS in colon cancer but not in rectal cancer.'

This study examined overtreatment in early-stage (cT1-2N0M0) colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who underwent definitive resection without pathologic upstaging. Using National Cancer Database (NCDB) data from 2010–2020, we identified risk factors for overtreatment and analyzed its impact on overall survival (OS). Younger age, Black race, and pT2 tumors were linked to overtreatment in colon cancer, while pT2 stage, poor differentiation, and high-risk histology were associated with rectal cancer overtreatment. Overtreatment correlated with worse OS in colon cancer but not in rectal cancer.
