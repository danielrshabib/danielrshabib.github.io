collection: publications
permalink: /publications/habib2026leveraging
excerpt: "This scoping review screened 1,752 studies and included 16 that analyzed online communities to gain insights on hearing aid (HA) and cochlear implant (CI) use. Three analytic approaches were identified—manual text coding, computational text analysis, and audiovisual content analysis—each offering distinct insights into patient narratives, sentiment patterns, and educational content. Online platforms were frequently used to share lived experiences, disseminate medical information, and provide peer support, highlighting their value for understanding HA and CI user perspectives."
