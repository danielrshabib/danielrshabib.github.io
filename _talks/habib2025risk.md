Head and neck cancer patients undergoing free flap surgery often face significant postoperative pain, especially patients with mental health disorders (MHD) or prior narcotic use. In this [oral presentation](https://danielrshabib.github.io/files/habib2025risk-presentation.pdf) involving 645 patients, sociodemographic variables, MHD, and osteocutaneous radial forearm free flap reconstruction were linked to higher pain scores and increased likelihood of inpatient pain service consultation. These findings highlight the need for tailored, proactive pain management strategies based on individual risk factors.
