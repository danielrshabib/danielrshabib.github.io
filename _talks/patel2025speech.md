Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) is a rare congenital condition often requiring surgical intervention to address feeding, airway, and speech challenges. Among 69 children with PRS, this [poster](https://danielrshabib.github.io/files/patel2025speech-poster.pdf) found that nearly half underwent Mandibular Distraction Osteogenesis (MDO) with a success rate of 73%. Despite cleft palate repair, 38% of patients developed velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), and 25% required additional speech surgery. No significant association was found between cleft palate repair techniques and VPI or subsequent surgeries, highlighting the need for further research to optimize speech outcomes in this population.
