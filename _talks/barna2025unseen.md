This study examines the psychosocial burden of non-flaccid facial paralysis (NFFP) and patient perceptions of treatment efficacy. A survey conducted among patients revealed that stress exacerbates NFFP symptoms for 62.8% of respondents, with many expressing concerns about their appearance and its impact on social interactions. Despite the significant emotional distress, only 27.3% of patients sought regular mental health support, though treatments like chemodenervation were found to effectively reduce self-consciousness and self-criticism. The findings underscore the profound effects of NFFP on self-image and social well-being, emphasizing the necessity for integrated care approaches that include mental health resources.
