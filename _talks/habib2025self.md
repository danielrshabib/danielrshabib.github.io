Although ENT issues account for up to 50% of pediatric and 25% of adult primary care visits, most medical schools do not offer formal ENT education. This [poster](https://danielrshabib.github.io/files/habib2025self-poster.pdf) investigates whether a short online module could improve medical studentsâ€™ knowledge about sinusitis, a common ENT condition, without significant additional time burden. Among 18 participating students, median test scores rose from 80% before the module to 100% afterward (p<.001), with most students completing the lesson in under 14 minutes. The results suggest that brief, focused ENT education can meaningfully improve student knowledge without adding significant time demands.
