This [oral presentation](https://danielrshabib.github.io/files/vittetoe2025patient-presentation.pdf) investigates the patient experience of those with non-flaccid facial paralysis (NFFP) regarding diagnosis, communication, and access to care. An anonymous survey was distributed to gather insights on treatment history, psychosocial impact, and provider interactions, revealing that patients often endure significant delays before receiving specialized care. Findings indicate that nearly half of respondents were previously misinformed about treatment options, leading to higher severity scores in those told there was "nothing else to do." Despite these challenges, patients demonstrate a strong willingness to seek long-term treatment and are open to paying for therapies that improve their condition.
