Depression is common in patients with head and neck cancer, affecting up to 40%, yet it often goes unrecognized. This oral presentation includes 709 patients who underwent major reconstructive surgery. Only 7.5% had documented preoperative depression, and 5.6% were on antidepressant medications. While depression alone was not linked to worse survival, patients taking SSRI/SNRI antidepressants had longer hospital stays and showed a trend toward lower survival, though not statistically significant. These findings suggest a need for better depression screening and highlight the potential impact of mental health on recovery after cancer surgery.
