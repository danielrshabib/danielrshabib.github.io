Positive surgical margins after total laryngectomy (TL) are known to be linked to cancer recurrence and survival, but it is unclear whether the type of positive margin matters. This [poster](https://danielrshabib.github.io/files/jin2026impact-poster.pdf) found that patients with positive mucosal margins had worse disease-free survival (DFS) than those with positive soft tissue margins using Cox proportional hazard analysis, although this difference was no longer significant after adjusting for other factors. These findings suggest that mucosal margin positivity may represent a higher-risk group that could benefit from closer follow-up or more tailored postoperative treatment, pending future work in a larger cohort.
