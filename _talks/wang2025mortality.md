Digestive cancer risk varies widely among Asian American subpopulations, but these differences are often overlooked in research. Using national mortality data from 2018–2023, this poster found that all Asian subgroups—except Asian Indians—had higher digestive cancer mortality compared to White Americans, with particularly high rates of stomach cancer in Korean Americans. Cultural, dietary, and socioeconomic factors likely contribute to these differences. Our findings highlight the need for more tailored cancer prevention, screening, and education efforts that reflect the diversity within the Asian American community.
