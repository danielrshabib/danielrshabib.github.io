Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is an aggressive cancer, and it remains unclear whether its origin affects outcomes. In this study of 68 patients, we found that while survival did not differ significantly between cancers arising de novo and those developing from a benign pleomorphic adenoma, patients with ex-pleomorphic adenoma SDC had higher 2-year survival rates. Distant metastasis was the most common form of treatment failure, especially in de novo cases. These findings suggest that histologic origin may reflect distinct disease behavior and support the need for further research and earlier systemic treatment strategies.
