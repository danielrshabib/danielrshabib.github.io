This oral presentation investigates if preoperative tracheostomy increases the risk of cancer recurrence and worse outcomes for patients undergoing total laryngectomy. In our study of 787 patients treated from 1999 to 2024, 306 (39%) had a tracheostomy before surgery. These patients had significantly worse overall survival, disease-free survival, and local recurrence-free survival, even after adjusting for factors like cancer stage and prior treatments. Tracheostomy was also associated with a trend toward more peristomal recurrences, particularly when the time between tracheostomy and surgery was longer.
